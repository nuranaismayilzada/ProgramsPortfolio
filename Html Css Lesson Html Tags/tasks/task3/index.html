        <h3>Linear Equations</h3>
        <p>A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form</p>
        <span>ax+b=0</span>
        <p>where a and b are real numbers and x is a variable.This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear equation.Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form.Also,the variable may or may not be an <i>x</i> so don't get too locked into always seeing an <i>x</i> there.</p>
        <h3>Quadratic Equation</h3>
        <p>The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:</p>
        <span>ax <sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0</span>
        <p>where <i>a</i> , <i>b</i>, <i>c</i> are known values and <i>x</i> is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet).Also, <i>a</i> can't be 0. </p>
        <h3>The area of a circle (A) </h3>
        <p><i> π</i>(Pi) times the radius (r) squared:</p>
        <span>A= π x r <sup>2</sup></span>
        <p>or,when you know the diameter ( <i>D</i> ):</p>
        <span>A=(π/4) x D <sup>2</sup></span>
        <p>or,when you know the circumference ( <i>C</i )>:</p>
        <span>A=C<sup>2</sup>/4 x π</span>
        <h3>Intersection</h3>
        <p>The intersection of two sets <u>A</u> and <u>B</u>, denoted by A>B,is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B.In symbols,</p>
        <span>A > B={x:x A an x < B } </span>
        <p>That is , <u>x</u> is an element of the intersection A < B if and only if <u>x</u> is both an element of <u>A</u> and an element of <u>B</u>.</p>
